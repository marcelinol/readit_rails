This app has the API to receive the links and details, and also has the view to show it.

In the future, it could integrate with pocket, raindrop or send emails, whatever. Let's just store and show the links first, right?

I intend to use hubot to send links to this app to save those links to Read It later. So, when someone recommends an article or a video in slack, I tell "hubot recommend it :arrow_up:" or something like that and it will be stored here :simple_smile:
